In this SQL code, I'm querying a database that's holding Nexflix data to answer questions about the data. 

---Join Tables---
SELECT 
people.show_id, titles.title, titles.release_year, titles.type, people.director
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
    
    LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
    ON people.show_id = titles.show_id;


---How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
SELECT COUNT(*)
 FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
 WHERE type ='Movie';

 ---When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
 SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
 FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

 ---List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT titles.title, titles.type
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ORDER BY title ASC;

 ---Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT
people.show_id, titles.title, people.director
    FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
    LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
    ON titles.show_id = people.show_id
    WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

---What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT titles.title, titles.release_year
 FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
 WHERE titles.type = 'Movie'
 ORDER BY release_year ASC;

 SELECT titles.title, titles.release_year
 FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
 WHERE titles.type = 'Movie'
 ORDER BY release_year ASC
 LIMIT 1;
